### Model saving for continous fine tuning


**What is ParlAI?**

ParlAI is a python-based platform for enabling dialog AI research.

Its goal is to provide researchers:

  * a unified framework for sharing, training and testing dialog models

  *  many popular datasets available all in one place, with the ability to multi-task over them

  * seamless integration of Amazon Mechanical Turk for data collection and human evaluation

  * integration with chat services like Facebook Messenger to connect agents with humans in a chat interface

In ParlAI, we call an environment a world. In each world, there are agents. Examples of agents include models and datasets. Agents interact with each other by taking turns acting and observing acts.

To concretize this, weâ€™ll consider the train loop used to train a Image Seq2Seq model trained on all DodecaDialogue tasks and fine-tuned on the Empathetic Dialogue task, We call this train environment a world, and it contains two agents - the seq2seq model and the dataset. The model and dataset agents interact with each other in this way: the dataset acts first and outputs a batch of train examples with the correct labels. The model observes this act to get the train examples, and then acts by doing a single train step on this batch (predicting labels and updating its parameters according to the loss). The dataset observes this act and outputs the next batch, and so on.


**Installation setup**

1. Install anaconda python. (https://anaconda.org/)
2. create a conda environment
``` 
conda create -n cortx pip python=3.7
```
3. activate the environment
``` 
conda activate cortx
```
4. Install the requirements
``` 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```





``` 

python application.py -mf zoo:blender/blender_90M/model -t blended_skill_talk

```
1. For each user there will be a unique id to seperate conversations. 
2. Each connection will include one world, one AI agent and multiple users.
